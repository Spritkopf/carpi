This project is abandoned. I'll leave this here, maybe someone finds it useful.

This was intended to become the software for a DIY head unit based on the raspberry pi. In the end I didn't complete it because I got a new car with infotainment built in, so sadly this was never finished.
I also initially didn't want to publish this, so there is a substantial lack of documentation...

### features so far###
- runs on raspberry pi
- based on Python + Kivy fur GUI
- uses Gstreamer for audio output
- media player for local music
- builds media library with tags and album cover art
- audio book player (not quite complete)
- audio equalizer with customizable presets
- (some) support for themes
- almost no documentation (sorry)


### Requirements ###

This project is based on Kivy 1.8.0. See their website for instructions how to install on Raspberry Pi
